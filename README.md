# cocos2d-x-3.2_tests_cpp-tests
cpp-tests folder cocos2d-x-3.2/tests/

Note I mainly change or maintain the folder of Classes, and perhaps Resources.
In order to run the tests project, we should download cocos2d-x-3.2 first, and then
put the cocos2d-x-3.2_tests_cpp-tests folder under cocos2d-x-3.2/tests/
